# Text Generation with GPT-2

This notebook demonstrates text generation using the GPT-2 model. GPT-2 is a transformer-based model trained on a diverse range of internet text data. Although the fully trained GPT-2 model is not publicly available due to concerns about potential misuse, a smaller version is accessible for experimentation.

## Overview

1. **Introduction**: This section provides an overview of the GPT-2 model and its use for text generation.
2. **Setup**: Installation and import of required libraries.
3. **Model Loading**: Loading the GPT-2 tokenizer and model.
4. **Text Generation**: Generating text based on input prompts.
5. **Beam Search**: Implementing Beam Search to improve text diversity and coherence.
